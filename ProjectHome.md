We present a method for performing inference about point processesthat might undergo sudden changes in their dynamics.  In particular, we consider the log-Guassian Cox process, which places a Guassian process prior distribution on the logarithm of the intensity function of a nonhomogeneous Poisson process.  We model potential changepoints in the intensity function using nonsationary changepoint covariance functions and will perform fully probabilistic changepoint detection by approximating the posterior distribution over putative changepoint locations.  We will also approximate the full posterior distribution over the intensity function, marginalizing out the model hyperparamters, in particular the locations of potential changepoints.  We will analyze two real-world datasets using these techniques.
